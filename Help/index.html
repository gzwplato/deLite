    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This is a scripting host environment created by <a href="mailto:lu@lucifael.com">Lucifael</a>
      for the purposes of creating scripts to work within Windows like some
      might use JScript or VBScript's. The Editor has options to allow you to
      run scripts at certain times, but there is also the ability to /run them
      from the command line for use in such things as HotAlarm Clock or the
      alike.</p>
    <h3>Hello World</h3>
    <p>No programming language, even a simple one like a scripting language
      would be complete without the Hello World Program. Below we'll go through
      the steps for your first ever script that will be the amazing Hello World!</p>
    <p>First things first, you need to create a new scripts. Open up the editor,
      an icon was created in your start menu for this. It's likely you already
      have it open if you're reading this anyway</p>
    <p>Click the New Button, or "CTRL+N" to create a new blank scripts. Some
      code will already be in place for you. The bit that's important right now
      is the part between <b>"begin"</b> and <b>"end."</b> This is where your
      mainstay of the code goes. Everything before is setting up for this part
      here.</p>
    <p>Now type the following into the editor, on a new line after <b>"begin"</b>.</p>
    <pre>WriteS('Hello World');</pre>
    <p>Type that exactly as shown. Now save the your first script to a file, to
      do this you can click "CTRL+S" to quickly save. Or use the save button, or
      menu entry. Mostly there are three ways of using Editor functions you can
      either use the menu where they are filed in logical order, by the
      corresponding button, or using the short key, which you can find by
      looking on the menu.</p>
    <p>Now test the program with CTRL+F9, which is compile, this tests the code
      is alright. If there is a problem make sure you typed in the test exactly.
      Otherwise, there should be no problems and you can use F9 to run the
      script.</p>
    <p>If you look on the debug tab you'll see "Hello World" is shown. That's
      your first script!</p>
    <h3>What's Next</h3>
    <p>This help file documents only the commands that I've added to the
      scripting language and as such this is not meant to be a tutorial on the
      language "Pascal" itself. There are plenty of those on the internet, I'll
      certainly be looking up a good one to link shortly</p>
    <p>Other than that, there are examples available from the Net Resources
      button, this allows you to download plenty of examples, and other useful
      things.</p>
