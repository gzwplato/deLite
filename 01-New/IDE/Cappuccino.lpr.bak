{
        Cappuccino IDE for deLite
        Made to be as professional quality as possible.
        There might not be a lot to the language yet, but there will be in time
        So the idea here is to make this modular, and somewhat future proof.

program Cappuccino;

uses
  {$IFDEF UNIX}{$IFDEF UseCThreads}
  cthreads,
  {$ENDIF}{$ENDIF}
  Interfaces, // this includes the LCL widgetset
  Forms, uIDE, frameBrowser, frameEditor, frameSolution,
  frameSolutionProperties, frameSnip, frameRTOutput, frameScriptOutput
  { you can add units after this };
